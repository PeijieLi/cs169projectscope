Feature: Students and Instructors can add comments to tasks, general metrics and iterations
  
  As a student or instructor,
  So that I can add information regarding tasks, general metrics and iterations,
  I want to be able to add comments in any of these locations

Background: users and project in the data base
  
  Given the following projects exist:
  | name      |
  | Project_1 |
  | Project_2 |

  Given the following iterations exist:
  | iteration_name |
  | iteration_01   |
  | iteration_11   |
  | iteration_02   |
  | iteration_12   |

  Given the following tasks exist:
  | title    | iteration_id | task_id |
  | first_1  | iteration_01 | first_1 |
  | second_1 | iteration_01 | first_1 |
  | first_2  | iteration_02 | first_2 |
  | second_2 | iteration_02 | first_2 |

  Given the following users exist:
  | provider_username       | uid         | email                 | provider  | role    | project   |
  | Admin                   | uadmin      | uadmin@example.com    | developer | admin   | Project_1 |
  | Student                 | ustudent    | ustudent@example.com  | developer | student | Project_1 |
  | Student2                | ustudent2   | ustudent2@example.com | developer | student | Project_2 |
